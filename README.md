# Movie-review-classification-system

Sentiment analysis of movie reviews is a valuable tool for understanding public opinion and gauging the overall reception of films. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in capturing the sequential nature of text data, making them well-suited for sentiment analysis tasks. This project explores the application of LSTMs to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using the IMDB dataset, a widely-used benchmark for sentiment analysis tasks.
